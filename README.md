# hello-world

Having earned my BSCpE degree, I am looking to continue honing my craft in software engineering and front-end development. I possess skills in coding (particularly C++, Java, and Python) and have ample experience in both team collaboration and working independently on projects. In regards to my work ethic, one of my biggest strengths is my thoroughness when completing assigned tasks.  Being a fast learner and eager to expand my skills, I aim to apply my programming knowledge to real world applications.
